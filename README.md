# Luhn-s-Algorithm-for-checksum-validation
This program takes reads in a number, doubles every other number starting from the second rightmost towards left. Turns the double digit numbers in the new string of numbers into single digits. If the sum of the new string is divisible by 10, then the original number is valid, else invalid. This is why this method is also known as "Mod 10" method

This simple program can be employed to detect credit card frauds and faulty IMEI numbers.
